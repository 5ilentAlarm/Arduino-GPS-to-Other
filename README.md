# Arduino-GPS-to-Other
Small project I created to test my GPS module. Used in my vehicle to track my distance and speed using thingspeak.

All that needs to be done is to setup Blynk and Thingspeak, and make sure to copy down the respective API keys. Then just input them into the arduino file and you're done there. I used my phone's hotspot to keep the arduino connected to WiFi. 
The python client ran on my desktop beforehand, and then it's all set up!
